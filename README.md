This have all the required functionality of managing and sorting the array data accordingly.
1)I have used Chart.js and react-chartjs-2 for displaying the chart of the array .
2)Provided Buttons for the sorting .
3)For resize I have turned the size of every bar half of its size every single time .For the 0 value scenario i have created a random value between 1,100 for the new value.
4)For the randomize I have shifted the value of i index to i+2th index to make a random array from the given values only.
